# Data comes from the Swift Data Center                                                   
# A 5 arcsec aperture is used to measure the counts for the coincidence loss correction,  
# a 3 or 5 arcsec source aperture (based on the error) was used for the aperture photometry 
# subtracting off the galaxy count rate in a template image  (if available),              
# and applying an aperture correction as appropriate (based on average psf in Swift CALDB)
# and zeropoints from Breeveld et al. (2011) which update Poole et al. (2008)             
# including a time-dependent sensitivity loss                                             
# to put the magnitudes on the UVOT photometric system described in that paper.   
# The sensitivity correction has been updated based on the 2015 redetermination.
